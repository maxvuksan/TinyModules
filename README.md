# Tiny Modules

*A software modular audio synthesizer.*

Instead of working on a timeline like traditional DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), Tiny Modules operates in patches producing a continous output signal. 

The tool is written in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and builds upon the [JUCE framework](https://juce.com/)
