# Tiny Modules

*A software modular audio synthesizer.*

The tool is written in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) with the [JUCE framework](https://juce.com/) and is under continued development. 

Instead of working on a timeline like traditional DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), Tiny Modules operates in patches producing a continuous output signal. 

A demo patch can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj5VAtoiq7Y)
