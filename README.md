# Tiny Modules

*A software modular audio synthesizer.*

Instead of working on a timeline like traditional DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), it operates in patches producing a continous output signal. Though a looping waveform is inevitable, it is the emergent output of different periods that produce new and interesting results. 

This is what Tiny Modules was built to explore.

The tool is written in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and builds upon the [JUCE framework](https://juce.com/)
